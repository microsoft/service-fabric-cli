          short-summary: The amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete before 
            FailureAction is executed. 
          long-summary: It is first interpreted as a string representing an

        - name: --unhealthy-nodes
          type: int
          short-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes
            before reporting an error
          long-summary: For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy,
            this value would be 10. The percentage represents the maximum
            tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the
            cluster is considered in error. If the percentage is respected but
            there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as
            Warning. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of
            unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster. The
            computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
            nodes. In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for
            repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

          type: int
          short-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy
            applications before reporting an error
          long-summary: For example, to allow 10% of applications to be
            unhealthy, this value would be 10. The percentage represents the
            maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy
            before the cluster is considered in error. If the percentage is
            respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the
            health is evaluated as Warning. This is calculated by dividing the
            number of unhealthy applications over the total number of
            application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of
            application types that are included in the
            ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap. The computation rounds up to
            tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications.

          short-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of nodes health

            the beginning of upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of
            the health evaluation. The check is performed after every upgrade
            domain upgrade completion to make sure the global state of the
            cluster is within tolerated limits.

          type: int
          short-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes

            upgrade domain nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of
            the upgrade domain nodes at the time of the health evaluation. The
            check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion
            for all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the
            upgrade domains is within tolerated limits.

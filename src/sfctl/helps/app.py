    type: command
    short-summary: Creates a Service Fabric compose deployment
    long-summary: Compose is a file format that describes multi-container applications.
        This API allows deploying container based applications defined in
        compose format in a Service Fabric cluster. Once the deployment is
        created, its status can be tracked via the `GetComposeDeploymentStatus`
        API.

        - name: --imagestore-string
          type: string
          short-summary: Destination image store to upload the application
              package to
          long-summary: To upload to a file location, start this parameter with 'file:'.
              Otherwise the value should be the image store connection string, such as the default
              value.
        - name: --compress
          type: bool
          short-summary: Applicable only to Service Fabric application packages. 
              Create a new folder containing the compressed application package to either the 
              default location, or to the location specified by the compressed-location parameter, 
              and then upload the newly created folder.
          long-summary: If there is already a compressed file generated by sfctl, it will
              be overwritten if this flag is set. An error will be returned if the directory
              is not an application package. If it is already a compressed application
              package, the folder will be copied over as is.
              By default, the newly created compressed application package will be deleted
              after a successful upload. If upload is not successful, please manually clean up
              the compressed package as needed. The deletion does not remove any empty dirs which 
              may have been created if the compressed location parameter references non existent 
              directories.

          short-summary: Whether or not to keep the generated compressed package on successful 
              upload completion
          long-summary: If not set, then on successful completion, the compressed app packages
              will be deleted. If upload was not successful, then the application package will
              always be kept in the output directory for re-upload.
        - name: --compressed-location
          type: string
          short-summary: The location to put the compressed application package
          long-summary: If no location is provided, the compressed package will be placed under
              a newly created folder called sfctl_compressed_temp under the parent directory specified
              in the path argument. For example, if the path argument has value C:/FolderA/AppPkg,
              then the compressed package will be added to C:/FolderA/sfctl_compressed_temp/AppPkg

      that upgrade description replaces the existing application description.
      This means that if the parameters are not specified, the existing
